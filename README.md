Horiseon Marketing Agency

The marketing agency wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so I used the Social Security Administration's ANDI (Accessibility Testing Tool) tool to run an analysis. The marketing agency's codebase passed all tests except for the benefits div container background color. The minimum requirement for contrast ratio is 4.5:1. I changed the background color from #2589bd to #1a7eb2 to meet the requirement. 

I fixed the semantic HTML elements and made sure that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. 

I also added clear and descriptive alt attributes to the images. 

There is now a concise title, "Horiseon Marketing Agency".
